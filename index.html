<!-- For accessibility, I included alt text for all images that describe what is on screen so that impaired people 
can still use the website with ease. I also broke sections up using the <section> tag instead of the <div> tag 
so that the content on screen was easily readable by screen readers.

In regards to SEO tactics, I properly titled all of my pages so that things flow easier and are correctly labeled when searched online.
I also kept the home page simple yet intriguing so that page view times are higher on average, and I made the tablet/phone sizes of the 
website just as easy to navigate as the full size so that people can access the website on multiple types of devices.

I tried out the embedded functions for both video and audio files into HTML, including adding controls to them. Although I'd never
utilized either before, they were relatively easy to use once I looked it up.

I used both a flow chart and sketches to determine how the page was going to be laid out. There've been a lot of times in the past where 
I didn't do any planning ahead and sort of dove in without thinking, but since this is a website I may flesh out more in the future, 
I wanted to take my time with it. The only problem is that, for some reason, my computer is not recognizing files located in parent folders. 
Because of this, I had to put all of my assets in one folder, which saves space but makes a cluttered mess. -->
