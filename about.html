            <p class="info">Alex Vancil is a local voice actor, graphic animator, and illustrator in the St. Louis Area. Having been creative 
                his entire life, making functional art seemed like the right direction for him to take. 
                Alex has worked on both personal story projects and projects for other people for the last four years, working for several
                small organizations and doing some work for St. Louis comic book artist Lorenzo Lizana.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="info">Coming from a creative family, Alex quickly followed in the footsteps of his ambitiously creative father, who would play
            pretend with him as a small child. His father crafted small blanket forts, large architectural playgrounds in the backyard,
            puppeteered monsters, and everything in-between. Alex's love for these designs led him down a creative path that sent him creating
            a network of art that stems from visual to audible, small-scale and large-scale.
        </p>
        <p class="info">And now, he wants to help your project get that magic creative touch. Having somebody on-board that can give feedback and help
            tweak ideas is one thing, but Alex will do so much more! He'll bring your ideas to life and imbue it with that same element of
            magic that everybody feels when they get a creative idea.
